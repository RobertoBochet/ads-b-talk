### How do I make a PDF out of the slides?

Click on the printer symbol in the bottom-left corner to get the printable version of the slides.

Then just use the print function of your browser to make a PDF of the page.

On **Chrome/ium** make sure you **scroll to the top** of your slides before printing,
otherwise, for whatever reason, the background of the slides will be borked.

On **Firefox** it is advised to enable *Print Backgrounds* under the *Options* tab,
to select paper size *Choukei 2 Envelope* and *Landscape* orientation.
